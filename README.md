This is a project that is attempting to make the raw data of the Chattanooga STAND survey a visual, and accessible, web application.

## Why?

At this point, why not? This large amount of public data is begging to be presented to the masses. Web technology gives us the tools to present this data in wonderfully dynamic way that can provide citizens and government meaningful insight

## That’s Awesome!

We thought so too when the project was started on 06/01/2013 on the 4th floor of the Chattanooga library for the National Day of Civic Hacking.
